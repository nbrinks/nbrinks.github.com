    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just recently started using Octopress to manage this blog, so I think it makes sense that my first post is about Octopress itself.</p>

<p>Several years ago I deployed a Drupal website but have since decided Drupal provided much more than I was looking for. Since Octopress doesn&#8217;t require a database the added benefit of migrating to Octopress means I can drop my paid hosting plan and instead deploy this website to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Now, to the point.</p>

<p>For the most part I was able to follow the setup instructions available at <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress.org</a>. Octopress.org also provides instructions and tools to <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">deploy to GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that wasn&#8217;t completely clear at first was how to get changes made to the configuration to take effect on the public facing website. Basically, the commands I was missing&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate
</span><span class='line'>rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Essentially, <code>rake generate</code> builds the public files and <code>rake deploy</code> pushes the changes to the master branch, which is then served up to vistors navigating your website. The repository where this website is hosted can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nbrinks/nbrinks.github.com">my GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>Another incredibly useful command,</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake preview</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Running this task starts a web server on your localhost. The web server is accessible by navigating to <code>http://localhost:4000</code>. A handy feature of the preview task is the ability to automatically regenerate the public files as you make changes to the code base. I have been using this feature exclusively while editing <code>.../octopress/sass/custom/_colors.scss</code> and creating this blog post.</p>
